        <h2>About This Visualization</h2>
        <p>
            This visualization, built with Plotly in Python, shows results at the state level for the U.S. Presidential
            General Elections from 1996 through 2016. You can hover over each state to see the portion of the vote in the
            state received by the Democratic candidate and the Republican candidate. Looking at these six maps together, we notice
            several things:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>There are some states like California, Oregon, Washington, Massachusetts and New York that are always blue,
                and other states like Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota and North Dakota that are always red.
            </li>
            <li>In 1996, Bill Clinton won a lot of states that no Democrat has won since then: Arizona, Louisiana,
                Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, and West Virginia.
            </li>
            <li>In 2016, Hillary Clinton lost some states that the Democratic candidate had won every election starting in 1996
                (or potentially earlier): Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.
            </li>
            <li>The two Obama maps look quite similar to each other. However, he won Indiana and North Carolina in 2008,
                the only time in these six elections that those states went to a Democrat. In 2012, Romney won those states.
            </li>
        </ul>

            I downloaded the 1996 through 2012 results from the

            created a CSV of just the Democratic and Republican candidate results, then merged that with unofficial 2016 results from
