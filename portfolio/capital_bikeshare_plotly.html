        <h2>About This Visualization</h2>
        <p>This interactive Plotly visualization shows hourly Capital Bikeshare trips for 3 different Sunday through Saturday weeks:
            July 17-23, 2016; September 11-17, 2016; and January 22-28, 2017. There are several patterns that emerge:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In all three of the weeks, on Monday through Friday, we see peaks at 8 am and 5 pm -- at typical morning and
                evening commuting hours. For the most part, the evening commute peak is higher than the morning commute peak.
                Perhaps this is because people are less concerned about getting sweaty after work, or because more bikes are
                available downtown at the end of the day (frequently in the mornings, all docks in residential areas are empty).
                It's also possible that there are the same number of commuters in the evening but a higher number of tourists
                riding at that time.</li>
            <li>The January 22-28 week, unsurprisingly, has the fewest trips per hour at almost all dates and times.
                The cold weather deters people from riding bikes.</li>
            <li>Some variation is likely a result of weather. For example, on Monday, July 18, 2016 and January 23, 2017,
                it was raining, and trips were relatively low during those days. On Wednesday, September 14, the high temperature
                was extremely high for September at 95 degrees F; the evening peak on that day was somewhat lower than
                the evening commute peak on other weekdays that week.</li>
        </ul>
