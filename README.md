Welcome to the Github page for my data visualization portfolio website. While using a template probably would have made my life easier, I wanted to build my HTML and CSS skills. What better way to learn than by coding my own website? 

I have tried to make the site as responsive as possible using media queries, flexbox, and CSS Grid, but have not done extensive testing across browsers and devices. 

Big thanks to [Ben Shope](https://github.com/benshope), [Lexis Hanson](https://github.com/lexishanson), and [Adam Kucharik](https://github.com/akucharik) for lots of help and advice. Thanks also to [Vincent Garreau](https://github.com/VincentGarreau) for creating and sharing the amazing particle animation that I've used on my home page and sadly cannot take credit for. And thanks to lots of other people who have inspired me with their websites and shared methods online for fun CSS animation techniques.

You can check out my website [here](http://elizabeth-shope.com/). I hope you enjoy the site and visualizations!
