                <h2>Assignment</h2>
                <p>Create two compound visualizations that each tell a different story. In other words, data can be used (and misused) to tell stories and to persuade. Use the *same* dataset to create two different stories (using compound/multiple visualizations for each). </p>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>I used the Energy Information Administration's data set "Net Generation by State by Type of Producer by Energy Source", which at the time of downloading (September 17, 2017) covers the years 1990 to 2015. The data can be found at <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/" target="_blank">https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/</a>.</p>
                <p>The data set contains five fields: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Year, which is one of the years from 1990 to 2015</li>
                    <li>State, which contains each of the 50 states, and also a U.S. total</li>
                    <li>Type of Producer, for example "Electric Generators, Electric Utilities" or "Combined Heat and Power, Commercial Power"</li>
                    <li>Energy Source, for example coal, natural gas, and wind. As with the state, there is also a "Total" option, aggregating all the energy sources</li>
                    <li>Generation, which is the amount of energy generated in that year and state, by that type of producer, and of the type of energy -- in megawatt hours (MWh) </li>
                </ul>
                <p>After cleaning out the totals from the State, Type of Producer, and Energy Source fields, the data set contained 25,719 observations (rows). </p>
                <p>Personally, I am extremely concerned about reducing our fossil fuel production and consumption, reduing our greenhouse gas emissions, and think that transitioning to sources like wind and solar is critical for this. Still, this visualization exercise was enlightening to see how easy it is to paint overly rosy or overly negative pictures about where we have come from and where we are headed with our energy production. </p>
                <h2>Compound Visualization 1</h2>
                <h4>Story</h4>
                <p>U.S. production of solar power started taking off after 2006. Since then, we have seen exponential growth in this energy source. California was an early player in solar power production, and has continued to be the top producer in the country. From 2006 to 2015, U.S. solar generation grew from approximately 1 million MWh per year to nearly 50 million MWh per year. In 2006, there were only 3 states generating solar power, while 34 states were producing solar power in 2015. If this rapid growth continues, solar is poised to become a major player in the U.S. energy generation industry in the next decade.</p>

                <h2>Compound Visualization 2</h2>
                <h4>Story</h4>
                <p>As coal production has dropped, natural gas has filled that gap, and then some. From 1990 to 2005, coal dropped from 52 percent to 33 percent of U.S. energy production, while natural gas increased from 12 percent to 33 percent. Looking at the absolute numbers, we see that natural gas production has grown far more than any other source in this time period. However, the percentages tell a different story: solar and wind have both grown astronomically -- by more than 6500 percent since 1990, and most of this growth has happened since 2006. If these rates of growth continue over the coming decade, this could force a reduction in natural gas production, and a further reduction in coal production. A clean energy future may be within reach!</p>
